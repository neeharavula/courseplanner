# Course Planner
```April - June 2023```<br><br>
In my Web Applications (CSE 185) class at UCSC, I worked in a team of 5 to develop a course planner tool for university students to organize and track their academic journey/performance. 
It also provides a way for students to share their coursework and four-year plans with one another to encourage informed academic planning decisions and foster community. 
The application is built with [PY4WEB](https://py4web.com/), a Python-based web framework that allows for the development of efficient database driven web applications (similar to Django or Flask).
